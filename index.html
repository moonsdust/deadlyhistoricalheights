          <p>
            Falling is the leading cause of death for expeditions in the Himalayas. 
            This tells us that despite the probable profiency of climbers, the treks 
            of the Himalayas are still quite dangerous and climbers must be cautious 
            on their trip.

            This shows that many climbers successfully reached the summit during spring and autumn.
