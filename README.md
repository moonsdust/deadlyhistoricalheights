## Description

Along the border between India, Nepal and China, the Himalayas are a popular mountain range system for mountaineers and researchers due to their scenic environment, being the freshwater source for many across Asia, and being at the forefront of understanding the impacts of climate change. Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth, is situated in the Himalayas and is a prominent expedition spot for people seeking a challenge. However, BBC reported on July 19, 2024, in their article, [“How bodies of frozen climbers were finally recovered from Everest 'death zone'”](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9r31g50xqdo), that the death toll has been increasing each year on mountains like Mount Everest, especially in the Death Zone, which is a region above 8000m from the ground where there isn’t enough oxygen to sustain life. 

Due to the increasing number of reported deaths in the Himalayas, this motivates our project, which is to understand various factors, such as the use of oxygen and the season, that contribute to the survival of climbers.
